# Doodle Jump Game (Assembly x86) ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the exciting world of Doodle Jump! This repository contains a simple implementation of the popular game using Assembly language for the x86 processor. Challenge yourself to reach new heights by guiding our character through platforms while dodging obstacles.

## Prerequisites ðŸ“‹

To run this game, you will need the following:

- DOS Emulator (e.g., DOSBox)
- Knowledge of Assembly language and the x86 processor.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up DOSBox on your system.
3. Mount the directory containing the game files as a drive in DOSBox.
4. Run the DOSBox emulator.
5. Change to the mounted drive in DOSBox.
6. Assemble the source code using an x86-compatible assembler (e.g., MASM).
7. Run the compiled executable file.

## How to Play ðŸŽ®

To control the character's movement, utilize the j and k keys on your keyboard. The character automatically jumps upon landing on a platform. Your objective is to leap from one platform to another, ascending to higher levels. Be cautious not to fall off the screen or collide with obstacles. Keep an eye on your score, which can be found in the upper right corner of the screen.
Beware of the bugs that lurk within the game! Make sure to steer clear of them as they can hinder your progress. Additionally, be cautious of red platforms, as they are broken and should be avoided.
